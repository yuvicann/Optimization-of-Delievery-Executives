# Optimization-of-Delievery-Executives

A quick commerce company needs to solve the challenge of assigning the right delivery executives to the right orders so that

- Delivery is completed within the promised time to the customer
- Delivery cost is minimized for the company

Feel free to make assumptions on speed of travel, cost paid to the delivery executive per km  and per minute etc and solve the optimization problem based on the techniques learnt in Sessions 1-4. 

Data is provided in two files

-	Sample Orders that consists of details of the store location, customer location, order amount, order packing time, delivery time promise made to the customer in minutes

-	Sample delivery executives that includes details of the delivery executives, their location when free from current order and time to get free from current order in minutes

Write down the formulation of the optimization problem and explain the formulation objective, decision variables, constraints and solution method adopted, solution arrived at in a document. Submit the document along with working code for the solution. Feel free to use any of the open source solvers and libraries.
